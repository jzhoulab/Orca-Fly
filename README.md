# Orca-Fly
The repository contains code for Orca-Fly, an adaptiation of Orca frameworks for multi-scale genome structure prediction in early Drosophila embryogenesis.


## Install and run Orca-Fly locally
Please follow the instructions at Orca [https://github.com/jzhoulab/orca/] to set up the Python environment.

## Predict with pretrained models
Please download the dataset and pretrained model weight by the link [TBD]. You can use `predict.ipynb` to get predictions of interested regions.

## Train Orca-Fly models
If you have set up Orca with its dependencies and has the necessary GPU resources, you can train new models following the example code under the `train` directory to train new Orca-Fly models.
